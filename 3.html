        <h2>JavaScript란 무엇인가?</h2>
        <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[6] often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level,<br />
            interpreted programming language. It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, <br />
            weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.<br />
            Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.<br />
            [7] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications.<br />
            The vast majority of websites use it,[8] and all major web browsers have a dedicated<br />
            JavaScript engine to execute it.
